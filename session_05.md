# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of creating machines that can mimic human-like thinking, decision-making, and behavior. Machine Learning is a subset of AI, but AI also includes other approaches, such as rule-based systems or robotics.
## Artificial General Intelligence
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a form of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human-like level. Unlike narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks (like playing chess or recognizing faces), AGI would have the flexibility to perform any intellectual task a human can do.
## History of Artificial Intelligence

### Perceptron
The Perceptron is one of the earliest types of artificial neural networks, and it forms the foundation for modern machine learning. It was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958 as a model of how neurons in the brain might work to process information.

How It Works:
Input Layer: The perceptron takes multiple inputs (like numerical data).

Weights and Bias: Each input is multiplied by a weight (indicating its importance) and summed up along with a bias term.

Activation Function: The result passes through an activation function (usually a step function) to decide whether the perceptron fires (outputs 1) or not (outputs 0).
### Backpropagation
Backpropagation is a foundational algorithm used in training artificial neural networks. It helps the network learn by adjusting its weights and biases to minimize errors in predictions. It is essentially an implementation of the gradient descent optimization method.

### 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics
The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton for their groundbreaking contributions to machine learning using artificial neural networks2. Their work has been pivotal in shaping the foundation of modern AI technologies.

John J. Hopfield developed associative memory models that can store and reconstruct patterns, inspired by physical systems like atomic spins.

Geoffrey E. Hinton introduced methods like the Boltzmann machine, enabling neural networks to autonomously identify patterns in data.
