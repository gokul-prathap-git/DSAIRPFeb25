# Linear Algebra
## Scalars
## Vectors
- Push or force in certain direction
- Lives in an abstract vector space
- Direction in abstract sense
- Can be 2D, 3D, ..., ND
- Notation basics
- Row vector, column vector
- Basis of vector
    - In terms of fundamental components: linear independance
    - Changing of basis
- Distance of a point from origin
- Magnitude/norms of vectors $L_1$ and $L_2$ norm, $L_p$ norm
- Unit vector
- Distance between points
    - Euclidean distance
    - Manhattan distance
- Dot product of vectors
    - Angle between two vectors
    - Concept of orthogonality
