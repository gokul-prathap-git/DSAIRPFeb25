## Agile Project Management (APM)

Agile Project Management (APM) emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid delivery of functional components, allowing teams to respond quickly to changes and evolving requirements. It enables the team members to work collaboratively with each other and with the customer. It motivates team members to faster development of the project. It works by breaking the processes into smaller chunks known as sprints. It entertains customers' feedback, which helps the development team to the changes in the sprint.
